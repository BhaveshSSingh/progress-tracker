Changes

I want a bento grid design -> Attached reference image
I want the app to be in dark mode only
I want you to use shadcn in charts for this
	- Also use different types of charts and graphs to make it look gamified

Forget about the backend for now ( use JSON where ever needed only focus on making the frontend perfect )
